    <string name="first_page">California Tree Squirrel Application</string>
    <string name="first_page_1">There are 4 species of tree squirrels currently living in California that are active during the day and therefore are likely to be observed by people.</string>
    <string name="first_page_2">Two of the 4 species are native to California while the other 2 species have been introduced to various parts of the state over the past 130 years.</string>
    <string name="first_page_3">By using this application you can participate in a real scientific research project that will map the current distribution of the 4 species throughout California and determine where an introduced species may have a negative impact on a native species.</string>
    <string name="first_page_4">An introduced species can interact with a native species in ways that are detrimental to the native species.</string>
    <string name="first_page_5">For example, the introduced eastern fox squirrel has replaced the native western gray squirrel in many locations within California, Oregon, and Washington states. And, the eastern fox squirrel is rapidly expanding its geographic range within California. The eastern gray squirrel is ranked among the 100 worst invasive species in the Global Invasive Species Database.</string>
